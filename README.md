We are from [Thomas Yeo's Computational Brain Imaging Group (CBIG)](https://sites.google.com/view/yeolab).

CBIG repository is a package that provides the following useful tools:  
1. fMRI preprocessing pipeline
2. Brain parcellations and algorithms
3. Mental disorder subtyping maps and algorithms
4. fMRI dynamical models (including neural mass models)
5. Registration between MNI and fsaverage space
6. Phenotypic prediction algorithms  

For more info, please check `stable_projects` folder.

Currently, CBIG mainly uses matlab, bash, csh, python and only supports **Linux** system.
